# Task 2
## Version of Terraform
Terraform v1.9.0
on linux_amd64
+ provider registry.terraform.io/kreuzwerker/docker v3.0.2

## Installation steps
1. Downloaded Terraform package for the AMD64 architecture from the official site https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install
2. Unpacked the package
3. Ran the binary file using terminal: 
$ ./terraform

## Initialization and application
$ ../terraform init

$ ../terraform apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

docker_container.nginx: Destroying... [id=0d20be677243be5886e96f7846a2916f4abe81bfb5d1cd5299e6a95d4a491dd4]

docker_image.nginx: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.

**Then check that the container was indeed destroyed:**

## Challenges
The only challenge I met is the necessity to run VPN to be able to use Terraform.
