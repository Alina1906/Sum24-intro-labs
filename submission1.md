### The benefits of signing commits

Signing commits in Git is a useful practice that helps keep code safe and reliable. It's beneficial for several reasons:

#### 1. Keeping commits unchanged
When commits are signed, a special signature ensures the commit content hasn’t been changed since it was signed. If anything is altered, the signature won’t match, showing that something might be wrong.

#### 2. Proving who made the commit
Signed commits use unique keys to verify who made the commit. This means you can be sure that the commit really came from the person it says it did, which is important for trust in team projects.

#### 3. Blocking unauthorized changes
By requiring signed commits, project leaders can make sure that only approved contributors can make changes. This helps prevent unauthorized changes to the code.

### Merge strategies

#### Standard merge
Merges all commits from the feature branch into the base branch with a merge commit.<br>
**Pros:**
- Maintains complete commit history and context.
- Clearly shows when features are merged.<br>
**Cons:**
- Can create a messy commit history.

#### Squash and merge
Squashes all feature branch commits into a single commit before merging.<br>
**Pros:**
- Simplifies commit history.
- Easier to track features.<br>
**Cons:**
- Loses individual commit details.
- Can cause recurring conflicts if branch is reused.

#### Rebase and merge
Rebases feature branch commits onto the base branch individually, maintaining a linear history.<br>
**Pros:**
- Keeps history clean and linear.
- Retains individual commit details.<br>
**Cons:**
- Requires manual conflict resolution and careful force pushing.
- Commits lose original signatures.

#### The preferable strategy to use in the collaborative environment
Standard merge is favored in collaborative environments for its comprehensive history and context, aiding in understanding and resolving complex conflicts.
