### The benefits of signing commits

Signing commits in Git is a useful practice that helps keep code safe and reliable. It's beneficial for several reasons:

#### 1. Keeping commits unchanged
When commits are signed, a special signature ensures the commit content hasn’t been changed since it was signed. If anything is altered, the signature won’t match, showing that something might be wrong.

#### 2. Proving who made the commit
Signed commits use unique keys to verify who made the commit. This means you can be sure that the commit really came from the person it says it did, which is important for trust in team projects.

#### 3. Blocking unauthorized changes
By requiring signed commits, project leaders can make sure that only approved contributors can make changes. This helps prevent unauthorized changes to the code.
